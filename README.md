# Spend-Sale-Prediction

> This is a Linear Regression portfolio project. Thus, this project focuses on <strong>Simple Linear Regression</strong> and its <strong>interpretability, foundational importance, and relevance in statistical learning</strong>. Even though it is necessary to discuss the best machine learning approach to solve this problem, this will not included in current stage, and may be discussed in the future work.

- Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to investigate the association between advertising and sales of a particular product.
- We are provided the dataset consists of the **sales** of one particular product in 200 diferent markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three diferent media: **TV**, **Radio**, and **newspaper**.
- Client has **full control** of advertising expenses in each of the three media.
- If we determine that there is an association between advertising and alses, then we can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly increasing sales.

# Objective

- This is designed as portfolio project, and mainly is designed to demonstrate the understanding of linear regression. We may not discuss the motivation of why using linear regression instead of other algorithms for this application.
- Our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.

# Important Questions that We Might Seek to Address

1. Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
2. How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?
3. Which media are associated with sales?
4. How large is the association between each medium and sales?
5. How accurately can we predict future sales?
6. Is the relationship linear?
7. Is there synergy among the advertising media?
